      "review": "Harper Lee’s ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ is a profound literary masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of time and place, delving into themes of morality, justice, and the human condition. Set in the racially segregated South during the 1930s, the story unfolds through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl with an unyielding curiosity and a keen sense of right and wrong. The novel begins with Scout reminiscing about her childhood in the sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama, where life seemed simple but was riddled with deep-seated prejudices. At the heart of the story is Atticus Finch, Scout’s father, a principled lawyer tasked with defending Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Atticus's unwavering commitment to justice and his determination to fight against the tide of bigotry make him one of the most iconic and admirable figures in literature.",
